Note that the protein FASTA files and the BLASTp output files are not in the data folder, as the file sizes are too large.  



Contents: 

* Identification of the orthologous pairs and in-paralogs between two bony-fish genomes, Latimeria chalumnae and Danio rerio (via a python script, **pandas** and **re** package). 
* Species tree reconciliation to identify the duplication and speciation events (using **MUSCLE**, **SeaView** and **FigTree**). 
* Assesment of the conservation of homologous sequences (using a python script: **pandas**, **re** and **collections::Counter** package).
